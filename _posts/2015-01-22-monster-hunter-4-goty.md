After a dismal year for games during 2014, it's time to get back on the hype train for another game!
I have pre-ordered both the collector's edition and the limited edition New 3DS for Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate,
and so should you!  But wait, after such a bad year for game titles and pre-orders, why would I be pre-ordering a game?
Because Monster Hunter 4G was released in Japan in 2013!  With the release date of 4 Ultimate (the English version) slated
for mid-February, surely there won't be any issues with the game; that isn't even sarcasm.

With the demo released recently, I have played a few hunts and I can thoroughly say that I am definitely looking forward for the release
of 4U; as if I wasn't already hyped when 4 was announced. 

### Why you should be excited too:
1) Online multiplayer mode for the 3DS

Yes, the lack of online for 3U on the 3DS was a disappointment; but we were better for it.
Now hunters with lack of nearby hunters will be able to find other players from around the world.

2) Two awesome weapons added

With MH4 and 4G, the Insect Glaive and Charge Blade have been added to the game and rebalanced.  Both weapons are quite fast and technical,
which is awesome for the series due to the added complexity to the game.  Since I am highly likely to mainly use the Charge Blade,
 here's a quick description of how awesome it is.  Imagine a large sword and shield, which you can stick the shield to the end of the sword, and it transforms into a huge axe, which then can explode.  Yeah, that's right; *awesome*.  It's as if the Sword and Shield, and Switch Axe had a child, who is a cousin to the GunLance.  Fairly fast, can dodge in all directions after attacks in Sword mode, can block with a shield, and can block-counter (Guard point) with certain animations, means you have all the necessary tools to dance with the monster.  Then with sick combos, and super huge and flashy finisher you have a real romantic weapon. *NICE ROMAN*

3) Tweaks and rebalance of previous weapons

Many weapons have gotten new moves and combos.  Other weapons have rebalanced movesets and powers.  The gunlance now is able to 
primarily use the shot as a viable method of attack, rather than a combo extender. The Longsword doesn't retain the spirit gauge indefinitely, but has new moves to more easily regain spirit gauges.  Slime has been reworked to be less effective.

4) The biggest cast yet

Many of the monsters from previous games are returning, after being left out of 3U.  Some have been left out, somewhat in part due to
the removal of underwater battles (woohoo).  Not only is the old and new monsters coming back, there will be even harder versions
of these monsters with the addition of the Frenzy virus, making them impossible to hurt under normal circumstances. And with more monsters, means more items, which means more armour and weapons to be forged!

5) Vertical combat and interesting terrain 

With the removal of underwater battles, the development of a new 3D battleground had to be made, and now in MH4 verticality has been added.
That is the terrain is now more dynamic with edges and levels to fight and jump off from.  Even higher cliffs to climb up and fight on multiple levels.  This makes each area of the map more interesting rather than 3U's little arenas in every area. The fluidity of the maps allows for more dynamic fights as you leap over bumps and craters in the ground.


Not interested yet?  Too bad, because you're missing out on the hundreds of hours of fun honing your skill to hunt monsters. I'll be seeing you in the hunting grounds.
