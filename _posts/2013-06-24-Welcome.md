Welcome to my new blog, again!  If you've read my previous blogs, then I suppose you're in for a treat because I created another one, here!  This time, I'm using GitHub Pages and Jekyll to host and create this blog because it sounded cool (and free!).  Definitely check those resources out if you want to create a simple and powerful blog.

So what is this blog going to be about?  Well, just about everything I suppose.  Mostly anything I find interesting to tell strangers about, or topics I just want to share that will take more than a few lines instead of posting on Google+ or Twitter.

Thanks for joining in, once again!
