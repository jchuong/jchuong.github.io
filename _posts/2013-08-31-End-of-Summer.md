title: End of Summer Term

It's been a while since I wrote any blogs. I just wanted to write that I have finished my work term at *EVault, A Seagate Company* and now I have to spend the next free week writing my work term report.  However, I do like to update my website because it is more interesting.

You may have noticed that the site has been receiving some updates, and I am almost ready to move the repo from private to public.  I do want to refactor a bit of the CSS to be less messy and make sure I have proper classes and ids for sections.

I also wanted to try this out to see if the CSS was acceptable:

{% highlight c++ %}
int main(char* argv, int argc)
{
	std::cout << "Hello world!\n";
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
