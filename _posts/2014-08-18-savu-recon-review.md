## Foreword

I'm back again with another peripheral review.  This time it's a double review with comparisons between the **Roccat Savu** and the **CM Storm Recon**.  Again, I am not an expert but I'd like to think I am an *enthusiast*, whatever credibility that gives me.  I've been using the Savu since around April 2013 to July 2014, so just over a year, before I bricked it.  Roccat support was awesome and let me RMA my Savu for a brand new one that I received recently.  I also should note that the Savu is starting to be harder to find at a reasonable price in Canada.  CanadaComputers has pulled the Savu from their website, Newegg is marked at $80, Amazon Canada at $60, TigerDirect at $68.  Of course, in the US this is better.  The MSRP is $60 USD so to have many of the stores in Canada selling above it might be telling of the stock levels (of course, Roccat isn't as big as a brand as say, Razer or Steelseries).  As a replacement for my Savu, I bought the CM Storm Recon and I have almost 2 months of use now.
