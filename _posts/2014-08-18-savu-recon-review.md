## Foreword
-----
I'm back again with another peripheral review.  This time it's a double review with comparisons between the **ROCCAT Savu** and the **CM Storm Recon**.  Again, I am not an expert but I'd like to think I am an *enthusiast*, whatever credibility that gives me.  I've been using the Savu since around April 2013 to July 2014, so just over a year, before I bricked it.  ROCCAT support was awesome and let me RMA my Savu for a brand new one that I received recently.  I also should note that the Savu is starting to be harder to find at a reasonable price in Canada.  CanadaComputers has pulled the Savu from their website, Newegg is marked at $80, Amazon Canada at $60, TigerDirect at $68.  Of course, in the US this is better.  The MSRP is $60 USD so to have many of the stores in Canada selling above it might be telling of the stock levels (of course, ROCCAT isn't as big as a brand as say, Razer or Steelseries).  As a replacement for my Savu, I bought the CM Storm Recon and I have almost 2 months of use now.

![Manual holder]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/savu-recon-review-img/manual-holder.jpg)

So inside the box contains the mouse and the manual holder.  The manual holder, as I call it, has the quick-start manual and a neat id card which has the product id on it.  This manual holder is not much different than the ones you see that come with Razer products.

Here's what the mouse looks like.  This is a definite right-handed mouse.  Stangely enough, it curves slightly to the right which is opposite of what you might expect from a right-handed mouse.  As you can see there is a single spot for the LED lighting.  On ROCCAT's website, the Savu is boasted to have 16.8 million colours, but strangely enough it is not on the packaging.  This is good because I don't believe that the Savu can deliver that amount of colour, or even a large fraction of it, to a noticable degree.  More on this later.  Moreover, you can see the braided cable the Savu uses,  which I like a lot.  Although my usage is only about a year, I have never seen any fraying of the braided cable, which is saying something since my Razer BlackWidow 2010 has a braided cable and has many frayed sections, even though the keyboard moves very little in comparison.

### <a name="savu-software"/>Software

Now let's take a quick look at the Savu settings software.  The Savu has on-board memory which means that all your profiles and settings are saved within the mouse, and can be used without the software.

![Savu Driver Software Main]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/savu-recon-review-img/savu-driver-main.png)

Here we see the main screen where the basic settings can be adjusted such as sensitivity, DPI and pointer speed.  Now, note that the Savu can have a separate sensitivity from Windows pointer speed, which is the "20G Acceleration" specification above; at least that is how it feels.  Furthermore, the DPI switcher can switch the current DPI, and lock/unlock which DPIs can be cycled through the Savu's button commands.  Another interesting feature that might not be obvious is the "Horizontal Tilt Speed (In tilt mode)".  It is **not** the ability to tilt the mouse left/right, but rather scroll left and right via button presses.  

![Savu Driver Software Button Assignment]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/savu-recon-review-img/savu-driver-button.png)

This is the button assignment page for the Savu.  By default, mouse5, or the "back" button is set to **Easy-Shift**, which is the equivalent to a modifier key much like CTRL or ALT on the keyboard.  By pressing that key down, you can map the other buttons to perform another function.  This makes the Savu from a 5 button mouse, to a mouse with 5 buttons and 9 functions.  I say nine functions because it doesn't make sense to bind the modifier to mouse 4/5 and use mouse 4/5 as the second key.  That is why ROCCAT has it *disabled*, and can't be modified.  Furthermore, the Easy-Shift button can only be mapped to mouse 4 and 5.

Here are some functions that a button can perform:

![Savu Driver Software Macros]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/savu-recon-review-img/savu-driver-macro.png) 

Deeper in the button assignment, you can program macros for the keybinds.  There are a few predefined macros already for popular games, such as the StarCraft 2 macros I am showing.  Of course, those predefines don't take into account that the keys could be rebound, so it works off of the default keybinds.  Furthermore, I don't reccommend using the macros for StarCraft 2 because Blizzard has said that macros are not allowed.  Ironic for the SteelSeries StarCraft 2 mouse and keyboard with macro buttons.  Anyways, it is possible to record and edit individual macros, set repetition and create your own set of macro keys.  This is useful if you like to have a profile for each application.

![Savu Driver Software Advanced Control]({{ site.url }}/assets/posts/savu-recon-review-img/savu-driver-advanced.png)

Now we are in the advanced tab of the software.  Here, we can set individual sensitivities for the X and Y axis, polling rate and colour control.  The important thing here is that you can turn off the sound from the software on specific events,  or change the volume all together, which is probably what you want since the software will *speak* to you.  A little more on that in the next section.  The colour control allows you to turn on the lighting, choose a single colour, custom colour and colour flow.  When I use custom colour, the LED does not always match what it the custom colour should be, which is why I am skeptical of the 16.8 million colours.  Also, white is **not** possible as a colour option, with 255/255/255 RGB I get a pink/fuchsia colour.  Breathing mode is the LED fading on and off, where color flow is breathing mode while cycling through the preset colors.

Here's a webm of the color flow option, using webm (need a capable HTML5 browser):
