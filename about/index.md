Hey that's me in San Francisco September 2014!
</p>
The author of this blog is me, James Chuong, often shortened to jchuong. Graduated with Bachelor's of Computer Science from University of Waterloo 2016. I like lots of techie things: computers, tech, mechanical keyboards, audio equipment, computer mice, gaming, eSports, coding, and recently fountain pens.

Currently working with [Instart Logic](//instartlogic.com).

## The Blog

Most of the posts will be just mainly informational or review articles of things I find interesting enough to post about, and less personal things.
