# The main repository for my blag
Generated with Jekyll and hosted on Github Pages

##Requires
* Ruby (Version > 2.3)
* Jekyll
* Github-pages gem

Because the blog is hosted on Github Pages, it only makes sense to use the Github-pages gem to develop locally before publishing changes.  Jekyll-sitemap and Jekyll-feed plugins are being used within the Github-pages gem.
